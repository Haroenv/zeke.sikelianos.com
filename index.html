<!-- <p>
  I've been fascinated with computers for as long as I can remember. My mother was a network
  administrator, so there was never any shortage of computer equipment lying around our house. I began experimenting with
  software and hardware from an early age, taking things apart and putting them back together to see
  how they worked. Now I'm a grown-ass man, and I still love doing that stuff. I've spent more than half my
  life making things on the Internet.
</p>

<p>
  I grew up in a family of <a href="http://beaver.zeke.sikelianos.com/">artists and artisans</a>, and
  even though I ended up in a highly technical field, I still hold art and design in high regard. I believe that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">information wants to be free</a>, and the work that I do is always in the service of that ideal.
</p>

<p>
  Today I'm a software developer at <a href="https://github.com/about">GitHub</a>, working on <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> and <a href="http://electron.atom.io">Electron</a>, two open-source projects for creating native applications using familiar web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
</p>

<p>
  I love to travel and move to new places. In the past five years I've lived in Los Angeles, Paris, San Francisco, Oakland, and New Orleans. These days I live in sunny Santa Barbara with my wife <a href="#">Jenelle</a> and our son <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/6IUj0eFvFU/?taken-by=nelbo_">Cosmos</a>, and we have another little one due in the spring.
</p>

<p>
  Please have a look around. Hopefully you'll find some of this work useful or at least amusing.
