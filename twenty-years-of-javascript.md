Twenty years of Javascript

I'm starting a new job today at a little company called npm.

When people who don't make websites ask me what npm is, I'm never quite sure how to respond. "Oh, npm is this thing where people who make stuff on the Internt can share that stuff with other people who so they can use it and make it better." True though this answer may be, it leaves a lot to be desired.

To really answer this question, I'm going to take you back twenty years, to 1994.



The World Wide Web was a toddler in 1994. Less than 10% of American


To help explain how and why npm came to be and just how important a role it plays in the development of today's world wibe web, I'm going to take you on a tour of the last twnenty years of my life.



The year is 2014, and it's been 18 years since you departed this earthly plane. When you died in 1996, the Internet was still a very new thing, and only a fraction of the populus had had a chance to use it.
