I grew up in a family of <a href="http://beaver.zeke.sikelianos.com/">artists and artisans</a>, and
though I ended up in a technical field, I still consider design and aesthetics to be essential to my work. I believe that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic">information wants to be free</a>, and the work I do is always in the service of that idea.

Today I'm a software developer at <a href="https://github.com/about">GitHub</a>, working on <a href="https://atom.io">Atom</a> and <a href="http://electron.atom.io">Electron</a>, two open-source projects for building native applications using familiar web technologies like HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

I love to travel. In the last five years I've moved a lot, from Los Angeles to Paris to San Francisco to Oakland to New Orleans and most recently Santa Barbara. I live with my wife <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nelbo_/">Jenelle</a> and our son <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/6IUj0eFvFU/?taken-by=nelbo_">Cosmos</a>, and we have another little one due in the spring.
