## npm

I'm starting a new job today at a little company called npm.

When people who don't make websites ask me what npm is, I'm never quite sure how to respond. "Oh, npm is this thing  for people who make stuff on the Internet and share it with other people who make stuff on the Internet."

npm is many things:

- a JavaScript package manager;
- an open-source tool;
- a command-line interface;
- a community of software developers;
- a newly-formed company in downtown Oakland, CA.

To really understand what npm is, its useful to know a little about the JavaScript programming language.

Let's go back to 1994, when I was thirteen and the World Wide Web was three.

To help explain how and why npm came to be and just how important a role it plays in the development of today's world wibe web, I'm going to take you on a tour of the last twnenty years of my life.

The year is 2014, and it's been 18 years since you departed this earthly plane. When you died in 1996, the Internet was still a very new thing, and only a fraction of the populus had had a chance to use it.


### AOL

My mother maintained the computer network at an engineering firm, where she had access to lots of old computers. After much nagging from me, she pieced together a computer for me with Windows 3.1, a 50mHz 486 processor, 32 MB RAM, a 500 MB hard drive, and a 9600-baud modem. This was to be the first machine I used to connect to the World Wide Web.

Some time in the early ninties, America Online started sending 3.5-inch floppy disks to every address in America, each disk offering a precious few hours of free access to the Internet. Anyone with a phone number and a computer with a modem could install this software and access the Internet for free.

The AOL software came bundled with Microsoft Internet Explorer 2.5. This is what it looked like:

At this time there were only a handful of browsers:

The World Wide Web had only been around a few years at this time
