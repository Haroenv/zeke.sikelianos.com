Heroku is a platform that simplifies the once-arduous task of deploying, running, and scaling web applications. I wore many hats at Heroku, including designer, engineer, product manager, and evangelist. I designed and implemented a full redesign of addons.heroku.com, Heroku's marketplace for cloud infrastructure providers, as well as other web properties like blog.heroku.com and help.heroku.com. In my last year with the company, I spent most of my time improving the Node.js development experience on Heroku by rewriting the build process from scratch, creating the semver.io microservice for resolving Node versions, writing documentation and blog posts, answering support tickets, and representing the company by speaking at conferences and mentoring at meetups.
