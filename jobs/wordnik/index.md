[Wordnik](http://wordnik.com) is a free English language reference site featuring definitions, related words, examples of popular usage, audio pronunciations, and photos. Its data is derived from a variety of sources such as the American Heritage Dictionary, Princeton Wordnet, Wiktionary, Wikipedia, Webster's 1913, and the Century Dictionary, one of the largest encyclopedic dictionaries of the English language. The wordnik.com website is a powered by the Wordnik API, a free and publicly available webservice for building language-based apps and games.

In 2011 and 2012, I designed, built, and maintained the high-traffic wordnik.com website, and also created [Swagger](/projects/swagger), a specification and tool for documenting, visualizing, and generating client SDKs for HTTP webservices.
