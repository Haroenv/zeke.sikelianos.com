After studying French at the University of New Mexico, I enrolled in a program to teach English at a public high school in L'Isle sur la Sorgue, a small town in Provence, France. The program was intended to encourage French students to develop their conversational English skills with native speakers.

During my year as a teacher, I developed activities and curriculum to encourage students to participate in discussions while learning about American culture.
