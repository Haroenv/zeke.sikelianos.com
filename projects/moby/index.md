moby-thesaurus.org is a free and open-source website for searching Moby Thesaurus, the largest thesaurus in the English language. Moby is a weird and wonderful reference full of unusual and illuminating word relationships. I created moby-thesaurus.org after years hoping and waiting for a good website or tool to come along for searching this amazing dataset.
