Swagger is a specification and open-source framework for describing, producing, consuming, and visualizing RESTful web services with JSON. I created Swagger while building [wordnik.com](https://wordnik.com) as a tool to help make our APIs easier to document, understand, and use. In the four years since its creation, a large community has developed around Swagger, and developers are continuing to find new and interesting ways to incorporate it into their JSON webservice implementations.

In 2015, Amazon Web Services introduced the [Amazon API Gateway](http://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/) with built-in support for Swagger APIs.
