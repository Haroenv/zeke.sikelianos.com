New York, NY – National non-profit arts organization, Fractured Atlas, was awarded a $350,000 contract
from The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation to begin developing the Bay Area Cultural Asset Map
(BACAM), a Hewlett Foundation project. The BACAM project seeks to create a constellation of discrete but
tightly integrated web applications that collectively aggregate, analyze and publicize data on the Bay Area
cultural sector.
BACAM will consist of multiple modules from which the cultural sector, funding community, policymakers and the
general public will be able to easily see who is making art, who is engaging with it, where is it happening, and
how is it being funded. Of BACAM, John McGuirk, The Hewlett Foundation’s Performing Arts Program Director
said, “A centralized database and asset map is potentially a very useful tool for funders, artists and arts
organizations, and the general public. We look forward to working closely with Fractured Atlas to develop and
pilot this new tool.”
The BACAM project leverages Fractured Atlas’s existing knowledge and expertise at the crossroads of
technology and the arts, its community engagement experience, and its relationship with software development
company Gemini SBS. Two current Fractured Atlas programs that best illustrate this expertise are NYC
Performing Arts Spaces (nycpaspaces.org), a comprehensive online database of rehearsal and performance
spaces for music, dance, and theatre around New York City, and Place + Displaced, a community mapping and
civic participation effort in multiple New York City neighborhoods that identifies sources of cultural vitality
through the lens of electoral districts, helping to build new channels of communication among artists and their
elected officials.
“We’re thrilled to be given this opportunity to help The Hewlett Foundation reach a deeper and more nuanced
understanding of the Bay Area arts community,” stated Adam Huttler, Executive Director of Fractured Atlas.
“Institutional funders are, obviously, essential participants in our cultural ecosystem. Anything that informs their
grantmaking will ultimately benefit the entire field.”
Fractured Atlas’s newly hired Research Director, Ian David Moss, will oversee BACAM data collection and
development.
