npmjs.com is the official web interface to npm, the package manager for JavaScript.
Every hour, this website helps thousands of node.js and frontend developers
discover and share node modules. During my time at npm, I was responsible for
the design, styling, development, support, and open-source stewardship of this
popular website.
